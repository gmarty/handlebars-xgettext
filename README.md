handlebars-xgettext
===================

Extract translatable strings from Handlebars templates.

## Getting Started

This script is called this way:
```` bash
$ node handlebars-xgettext path/to/handlebars/templates/ translation.pot
````

This will find all the files located in `path/to/handlebars/templates/`, extract translatable strings and create a file called `translation.pot`.

The POT file is a catalog model used to update PO files.

Translatable strings should be marked up like this:
```` html
<button class="btn btn-large">{{gettext "Login"}}</button>
````

## Documentation

The `gettext` helper can also be aliased to `_`:
```` html
<button class="btn btn-large">{{_ "Login"}}</button>
````

It is up to you to define the i18n logic. But you should probably do something like this in your JavaScript:
```` javascript
Handlebars.registerHelper('_', function(key) {
  return i18n.gettext(key);
});
````

[Jed](http://slexaxton.github.com/Jed/) is a very convenient library to manage internationalization from JavaScript in the gettext way.

## Warning

handlebars-xgettext is at a very early stage of development and may not meet your requirements at the moment.

A lot of common features of xgettext are not yet implemented.

But we plan on improving stability and functionalities (see @todo annotations). As such, pull requests and issues are greatly appreciated ;-)

## Note

handlebars-xgettext development was founded by [Dijiwan](http://www.dijiwan.com/). We use it extensively on production.
